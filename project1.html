                            <b>Responsibilities:</b> Worked with a team of 20 students to develop a rover that is deployable in a Martian and  Lunar terrains.Iwas part of the subsystem that was in charge of designing and manufacturing of the steering and suspension units.We used Solidworks and AutoCAD to design the systems and manufacture it. We assembled the A-arms, wishbones and the steering unit and tested it several times before our run at MSFC, NASA, Huntsville, Alabama. </p>
                            <p><b>Design: </b> Solidworks, AutoCAD, Catia</p>
                            <p><b>Lessons Learned: </b> This project taught me a significant lesson in allocating time into deadlines for unexpected parts delays, trying to understand and bridge communication and technical gap between team members, and scheduling availability of team members' with specialized skills. Towards the end of the Challenge, we were able to understand how the designs could have been as the systems performed nominally for first round but succumbed at subsquent rounds. Looking back, we could have tested the rover to harder terrains to verify the designs.

                            <p> <b>Structure: </b>SAE BAJA, India Chapter is an annual student competetion conducted by SAE India at Pithampur, India. At SEC,  we were a team of 25 engineers responsible for the design of the All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) conforming to the rulebook set by SAE India. We worked on the design, analysis, manufacturing and assembly of the various subsystems- Steering, Suspension, Structures, Electrical of the vehicle.I worked on the design of battery box and cooling system design for the electrical units. Apart from the work with the electrical team, I was involved in the manufacturing and assembly of various parts of the vehicle.
                                                  The competetion requires us to clear static testing before entering into the dynamic testing events. </p>

                            <p><b>Hardware: </b> Mahindra Reva e2o : Batteries, motor and BMS.
                            <p><b>Lessons Learned: </b> From this project, I learned the value of building and testing early. Although the efforts from the team were the high, we couldn't clear all static tests to qualify for the dynamic tests. This taught me that we have test very components before and after integrating into the vehicle. I learnt a lot about vehicle modelling and intricacies involving the design and control of powertrain for electric vehicles.

                            <b>Description: </b> The goal of the Hyperloop team is to design, manufacture and run a hyperloop system at the SpaceX Hyperloop Competetion. Our team is consists students from different areas of expertise from engineering to marketing and work together on mechanical and electrical parts of the pod. We have the Suspension, Structural, Cooling systems under mechanical and Electronics package, propulsion and control unit under electrical teams.
                            <p><b>Structure:</b> The design of the shape of fairing is being done in a trial and error basis to identify which would a better fit our pod. 2D Code has been written to simulate aerodynamics, effects of vibration, thermal analysis of the interior of the pod and cooling system.I have contribute the system analysis: Aerodynamics, Vibrations, Thermal analysis and Cooling system design of the pod.
                            <p><b>Language:</b> MATLAB and SIMULINK
                            <p><b>Design:</b> SOLIDWORKS
                            <p><b>Lessons Learned: </b> From being involved in every phase of this project: design and analysis, I learnt about the importance of testing early, scheduling deadlines, and best practices in designing the fairing, thermal system design and effects of vibration, flow dynamics in a hyperloop system. Cooling system is critical to the effective functioning of the pod and the control electronics board is sensitive to temperature changes. It has been challenging designing the internal systems to conform to effective functioning at low vaccum pressures.

                            <p><b>Structure: </b> The new system was designed based the data available from past designs of the pressure driven system. The main motivation behind new design is to higher efficiency and enable the rocket to go higher. 
                            Various cycles are being considered are: Gas generator, Staged combustion, Full flow staged combustion and, expander cycle to model the characteristics which would be best suited for the team in the future. A comparative study is being made as well. 
                            <p><b>Lessons Learned: </b> From being involved in every phase of this project: design and conduct analysis of different systems within the turbomachinery has been a great learning experience. The past experience through an internship helped me further.
